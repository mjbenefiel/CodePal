<h2> About CodePal </h2>
Connecting with developers has never been easier. Form a study group, a startup, or set out to disrupt the entire industry. The future belongs to you with CodePal. 

Many times online communities like freeCodeCamp are great for sharing knowledge and experience; however, the user's social experience really stops there. CodePal makes it easier for developers from across the globe to "pair up" or "meet up" to begin a coding journey together. This is different from a mentor/apprentice type of relationship. Like-minded programmers can determine if their skills and goals are aligned enough to kick off a new adventure together, or with a group.

Users have the ability to customize their profiles so they can match with coders who have similar experience, skills and goals. Users can link their GitHub, portfolio, and other social media networks, so others can view their information to determine if they'd make a good match. Users can also utilize the knowledge forum and chatroom while they're on the site.

Never code alone. CodePal is about networking and forming groups to learn and build off of each other without the formal "mentor/student" feel. CodePal can be great for self-taught coders looking for an easy way to meet like-minded programmers, or even experienced coders looking to expand their network.

<h2>Technologies used</h2>

<strong>HTML/CSS/Javascript</strong> - CodePal was built using these core technologies. Both hand-crafted code and robust libraries were used to create the features necessary to give CodePal a modern style, with an easy-to-use experience.  

<strong>jQuery</strong> - Much of the smooth interactivity of CodePal is put into motion with jQuery.  Moving information to and from relational databases is made much smoother with the use of jQuery.    

<strong>Axios</strong> - CodePal utilizes Axios, a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a Node.js environment. It basically provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequest s and node's http interface. Besides that, it wraps the requests using a polyfill for ES6 new's promise syntax.

<strong>JSON</strong> - Communication between servers, relational databases, and front-end rendering relies heavily on the constructing and parsing of JSON objects.  

<strong>React</strong> - CodePal uses React, a front-end library developed by Facebook. It's used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React allows developers to create reusable UI components. It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript libraries and it has strong foundation and large community behind it.

<strong>Heroku</strong> - CodePal is now accessible from anywhere in the universe that has access to the world wide web thanks to the Heroku cloud platform and their willingness to aid developers by allowing for free and easy app deployment.

<strong>MongoDB</strong> - MongoDB is a cross-platform and open-source document-oriented database, a kind of NoSQL database. As a NoSQL database, MongoDB shuns the relational databaseâ€™s table-based structure to adapt JSON-like documents that have dynamic schemas which it calls BSON. 

<strong>Mongoose</strong> - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

<strong>Node</strong> - Servers were built on the Node.js platform. Using an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment allowed us to customize many available libraries to suit CodePal.

<strong>Express</strong> - Express was chosen for its fast, unopinionated, and minimalist qualities as our web framework for CodePal.

<strong>Passport</strong> - CodePal is using Passport, an authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

<strong>Git</strong> - As with all projects, Git remains invaluable to the creation, development, communication, and support of CodePal.

<strong>Trello</strong> - Our team systematically set project goals, created and met deadlines, shared ideas, and coordinated efforts with the help of Trello.
