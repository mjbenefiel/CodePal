<h2>Technologies used</h2>

<strong>HTML/CSS/Javascript</strong> - CodePal was built using these core technologies. Both hand-crafted code and robust libraries were used to create the features necessary to give CodePal a modern style, with an easy-to-use experience.  

<strong>jQuery</strong> - Much of the smooth interactivity of CodePal is put into motion with jQuery.  Moving information to and from relational databases is made much smoother with the use of jQuery.    

<strong>Axios</strong> -

<strong>JSON</strong> - Communication between servers, relational databases, and front-end rendering relies heavily on the constructing and parsing of JSON objects.  

<strong>React</strong> - 

<strong>Heroku</strong> - CodePal is now accessible from anywhere in the universe that has access to the world wide web thanks to the Heroku cloud platform and their willingness to aid developers by allowing for free and easy app deployment.

<strong>MongoDB</strong> - 

<strong>Mongoose</strong> - 

<strong>Node</strong> - Servers were built on the Node.js platform. Using an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment allowed us to customize many available libraries to suit CodePal.

<strong>Express</strong> - Express was chosen for its fast, unopinionated, and minimalist qualities as our web framework for CodePal.

<strong>Git</strong> - As with all projects, Git remains invaluable to the creation, development, communication, and support of CodePal.

<strong>Trello</strong> - Our team systematically set project goals, created and met deadlines, shared ideas, and coordinated efforts with the help of Trello.
